# scheduler-app
An App containing a to do list of items

# Overview

The main app of working on this project was to enhance my skills 
in working with Java, which is a widely used programming language that is used to build software by many developers and engineers.

# scheduler-app
A scheduler app that allows the user to schedule tasks that they want to complete.

My purpose for building this App is to demonstrate how Java can be used to build an application that can be used in the real world to remind users of important tasks that they want to complete.
